http://localhost:8080/get/data
I have created a simple REST API using Spring Boot that returns a UserEntity object when you access the /get/data endpoint.

When a GET request is made to http://localhost:8080/get/data, the getUe() method is invoked.
The getUe() method returns the UserEntity object, which contains the hardcoded values for id, name, and email.
Spring Boot automatically converts the UserEntity object into JSON format and returns it as the HTTP response.

http://localhost:8080/actuator

This endpoint provides a hypermedia-driven view of available actuator endpoints within your Spring Boot application. 
Each endpoint is represented as a link (_links), which gives access to specific functionalities like checking the 
application's health, viewing beans, environment properties, and more.

Here's a breakdown of some of the key actuator endpoints listed in your JSON response:

self:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator
Description: The root of the actuator endpoints.
beans:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans
Description: Provides a complete list of all the Spring beans in your application context along with their details.
caches:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/caches
Description: Displays a list of available caches.
caches-cache: A templated endpoint to access specific cache details.
health:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
Description: Provides application health information, such as the status (UP, DOWN, etc.).
info:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
Description: Displays arbitrary application information. The content can be customized through the application.properties file.
conditions:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/conditions
Description: Displays the auto-configuration conditions and the reason why they were matched or not.
configprops:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/configprops
Description: Lists all @ConfigurationProperties beans and their current values.
env:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/env
Description: Shows properties from the Spring Environment, including system properties, environment variables, and application properties.
env-toMatch: A templated endpoint to retrieve specific environment property details.
loggers:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers
Description: Shows and configures the logging levels of your application.
loggers-name: A templated endpoint to configure or retrieve information about a specific logger.
heapdump:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/heapdump
Description: Generates a heap dump of the JVM running the application.
threaddump:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/threaddump
Description: Provides a thread dump of the JVM.
metrics:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
Description: Shows various metrics related to the application (e.g., memory usage, CPU usage).
metrics-requiredMetricName: A templated endpoint to access specific metric details.
sbom:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/sbom
Description: Provides a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the application.
scheduledtasks:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/scheduledtasks
Description: Displays the details of scheduled tasks within the application.
mappings:

URL: http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings
Description: Shows a list of all @RequestMapping paths and the corresponding methods in the application.
These endpoints are very powerful for monitoring and managing a Spring Boot application, especially in production environments. 
The availability of these endpoints can be controlled through your application.properties file, 
and access to sensitive endpoints should be secured appropriately.
